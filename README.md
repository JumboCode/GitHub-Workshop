# Workshop Goals
The goal of this workshop is to provide a baseline familiarity with using git + GitHub. At the end of this workshop, you should be able to 
- Clone a repo
- Create a branch
- Commit changes
- Create a pull request
- Approve a pull request
- Land your changes

Essentially, the basic functionalities of a GitHub-based development pipeline.

# Instructions:
0. Ensure you are a colaborator on this repo! Talk to your PM if you are not, and they will add you. 

1. Clone this repo: 
`git clone https://github.com/JumboCode/GitHub-Workshop.git`

2. Create a new branch. Label it with your name and the feature:
`git branch [first name]-[last name]/workshop`
e.g. `git branch tony-monaco/workshop`

When making branches, it's important that their names correlate directly to their new feature. In an actual repo, this might be something like `ton-manaco/header-bar-styling`

3. Ensure your branch was created by running `git branch`. This will list your branches, you should see something like 
$ git branch
$ * master
$ tony-manaco/workshop
