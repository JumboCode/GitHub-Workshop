- Clone a repo

- Commit changes
- Create a pull request
- Approve a pull request

Essentially, the basic functionalities of a GitHub-based development pipeline.

# Instructions:
0. Ensure you are a colaborator on this repo! Talk to your PM if you are not, and they will add you. 

1. Clone this repo: 
`git clone https://github.com/JumboCode/GitHub-Workshop.git`

2. Create a new branch. Label it with your name and the feature:
`git branch [first name]-[last name]/workshop`
e.g. `git branch tony-monaco/workshop`

When making branches, it's important that their names collarate directly to their new feature. In an actaul repo, this might be something like `ton-manaco/header-bar-styling`
